- Install the [contextmenu](https://packagist.org/packages/johndoh/contextmenu) and [automatic addressbook](https://packagist.org/packages/projectmyst/automatic_addressbook) plugins by default
- Allow to install the [CardDAV](https://packagist.org/packages/roundcube/carddav) (address book) synchronization plugin at the installation - note that if you have installed Nextcloud or Ba√Økal, it will automatically add the corresponding and existing address book.
