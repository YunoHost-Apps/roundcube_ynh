Roundcube is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an application-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect from an email client, including MIME support, address book, folder manipulation, message searching and spell checking.

## YunoHost specific features

 * Synchronize your email aliases as identities in Roundcube
 * Install the [contextmenu](https://packagist.org/packages/johndoh/contextmenu) and [automatic addressbook](https://packagist.org/packages/projectmyst/automatic_addressbook) plugins by default
 * Allow to install the [CardDAV](https://packagist.org/packages/roundcube/carddav) (address book) synchronization plugin at the installation - note that if you have installed Nextcloud or Ba√Økal, it will automatically add the corresponding and existing address book.
